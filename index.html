            <p> I currently work at the printing division of Phase 3 Marketing & Communications <a
                    href="https://www.phase3mc.com">www.phase3mc.com.</a> As the small format printing manager I
                work
                with
                the operations manager and our project coordination team to make sure our work is of high quality
                and is
                completed on time. I have a solid background in prepress and I work with Adobe Creative Suite
                software
                to
                manipulate files and color correct files as necessary for printing. I am also responsible for the
                operation
                and maintenence of two iGEN digital printing machines. I am hoping to make a transition into web
                development
                and
                I am here at Georgia Tech to learn all about it with the intention of making a career change.</p>
            <p> Apart from spending much of my time at work I also enjoy playing tennis, listening to
                inspirational podcasts, cycling, cooking, hiking, nature & spending time with my partner & my dog. I
                am
                a
                perpetual work in progress!</p>
